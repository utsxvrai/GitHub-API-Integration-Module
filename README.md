Author: Utsav Rai
Version: v1

This script facilitates communication and information retrieval from GitHub using REST API calls.

## Usage

Please provide your GitHub token and REST API expression as input to the script.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system.
- Obtain a GitHub token for authentication.

## Instructions

1. Run the script with your GitHub token and REST API expression as arguments.
2. The script will make REST API calls to GitHub using the provided token.
3. It handles pagination for multi-page results automatically.
4. The script appends the API responses to a temporary file for further processing.

## Script Functionality

- It checks if the result is paginated.
- If the result is on multiple pages, it retrieves data from each page.
- The script appends the API responses to a temporary file for consolidated output.

## Example Usage

```bash
./script.sh [your_github_token] [REST_expression]

```

## Note

- Ensure your GitHub token has the necessary permissions for the API calls.
- Review the generated output file for the API responses.

Feel free to customize and enhance the script as needed for your specific use case.
